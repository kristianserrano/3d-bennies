# 3D Bennies

This module is a fork of [More Bennies - SWADE](https://github.com/brunocalado/swade-more-bennies) developed by brunocalado#1650. It allows you to select 3d models of objects as your Bennies.

3D Bennies makes several changes to the original module.

- Strictly places control of selecting the Benny in the GM's hands.
- Includes only a subset of models available.
- Removes animations from remaining models.

## Installation

You can install this module with this link:

## How to Choose a Benny

After activating the module, go to Configuration Settings and select the model you'd like to use under the 3D Bennies setting. Save your changes and follow the prompt to reload the application. This will set the default model for the `db` "die" for all users.
